# [Emotion Site](https://emotion.sh)

## Docs

All of the docs live in the `docs` in the root of this repository. They are in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and they should include the following frontmatter at the top of each file that specifies the title for the page.

```yaml
---
title: "Some Title"
---
```

### Code Blocks

When the langauge is `jsx live` the code block will have a preview next to it and all of emotion and react-emotion's exports are available along with a `render` function that accepts a react element and will render into the preview next to it.

```md
\`\`\`jsx
// @live

render('some react element')
\`\`\`
```

### Links

All links to other pages on the docs should be linked to with `https://emotion.sh/docs/doc-name`, these links are transformed so they are local links.
