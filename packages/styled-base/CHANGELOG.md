# @emotion/styled-base

## 11.0.0-next.3

### Major Changes

- [`f9feab1a`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/f9feab1a5d1ca88e53c3f7a063be5d5871cc93e8) [#1575](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/1575) Thanks [@mitchellhamilton](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton)! - Removed support for `@emotion/styled-base` package. It has been moved to `@emotion/styled` and is available as `@emotion/styled/base`. This simplifies how the regular and base versions relate to each other and eliminates problems with stricter package managers when `@emotion/styled-base` was not installed explicitly by a user.
