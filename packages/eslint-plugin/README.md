# @emotion/eslint-plugin

> ESLint rules for emotion

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```
$ npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `@emotion/eslint-plugin`:

```
$ npm install @emotion/eslint-plugin --save-dev
```

**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `@emotion/eslint-plugin` globally.

## Usage

Add `@emotion` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit `/eslint-plugin`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@emotion"]
}
```

Then configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "@emotion/jsx-import": "error"
  }
}
```

## Emotion 11 codemod

The Emotion 11 codemods are contained in this package. To use them, enable the rule shown below.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "@emotion/pkg-renaming": "error"
  }
}
```

## Emotion 10 codemods

The Emotion 10 codemods are contained in this package. To use them, enable the rules shown below. Keeping these rules after migrating is also useful to have `jsx` from `@emotion/react` automatically imported when the css prop is used and other such things. You may also want to not enable certain rules while you are migrating or forever, such the `no-vanilla` rule.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "@emotion/jsx-import": "error",
    "@emotion/no-vanilla": "error",
    "@emotion/import-from-emotion": "error",
    "@emotion/styled-import": "error"
  }
}
```

> **Note:**
>
> These rules assume you are using React, if you are not using React, you should keep using the `emotion` package.
