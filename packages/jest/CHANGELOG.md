### Patch Changes

- [`66ccd43e`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/66ccd43e4c1ed44fb11950d663f6cb0be4ab3415) [#2269](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2269) Thanks [@mskelton](https://github.com/mskelton)! - Fixed the Enzyme serializer to work properly with conditional styles passed to the `css` prop.

* [`66ccd43e`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/66ccd43e4c1ed44fb11950d663f6cb0be4ab3415) [#2269](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2269) Thanks [@mskelton](https://github.com/mskelton)! - Fixed the Enzyme serializer to always print composed styles (for example using arrays), which are passed to the `css` prop, correctly.

## 11.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`0c31ed05`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/0c31ed05e564c4e68d11862e23d96003c6b7e4b5) [#2233](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2233) Thanks [@ajs139](https://github.com/ajs139)! - Fixed an issue with Enzyme snapshots for components using an array as the `css` prop - those should be printed OK now.

## 11.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c470c855`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/c470c8556a05e3af83b067c51cdd29f8655f7dbf) [#2109](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2109) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - `createEnzymeSerializer` export has been removed from the root entrypoint and moved to a dedicated `@emotion/jest/enzyme` entrypoint. This is unfortunate because it could be considered a breaking change but it has been decided to treat this as a bug fix. It was never the intention to export this from the root entrypoint - `enzyme-to-json` has been marked as an optional peer dependency of `@emotion/jest` since the release and it was the package structure that did not match this expectation by mistake.

## 11.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`b8476e08`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/b8476e08af4a2e8de94a112cb0daf6e8e4d56fe1) [#1675](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/1675) Thanks [@mitchellhamilton](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton)! - Rename `jest-emotion` to `@emotion/jest`. Please replace `"snapshotSerializers": ["jest-emotion"]` with `"snapshotSerializers": ["@emotion/jest/serializer"]` if you're using the snapshot serializer. Also replace any imports of `jest-emotion` with `@emotion/jest` or use the `@emotion/pkg-renaming` ESLint rule from `@emotion/eslint-plugin`.

* [`ca599c5f`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/ca599c5f392b5b1f51430dc9d8b263ed54856401) [#1901](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/1901) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - `test` & `print` are no longer exported as named exports. If you want to access the default serializer just access the default export. This means that `@emotion/jest`(previously `jest-emotion`) can't be used directly in the `snapshotSerializers` option, you should use `@emotion/jest/serializer` instead for this.

It's possible to get those elements when traversing Enzyme's trees.
