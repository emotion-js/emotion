# @emotion/utils

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2819](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2819) [`bbad8c79`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/bbad8c79937f8dfd5d93bf485c1e9ec44124d228) Thanks [@nicksrandall](https://github.com/nicksrandall)! - `exports` field has been added to the `package.json` manifest. This fixes how our default exports are treated by Node.js when using their native support for ES modules. It also limits what files can be imported from a package but we've tried our best to allow importing all the files that were considered to be a part of the public API.

It fixes the issue with browser-specific files being prioritized by some bundlers when targeting workers.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2600](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2600) [`2f27156a`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/2f27156a73f94c3aac82e4ed492cbfdc97225573) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Introduced `registerStyles` helper that is shared across between other packages. This is just an internal util that shouldn't be used by packages other than `@emotion/*` packages.
