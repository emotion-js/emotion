# @emotion/utils

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#3029](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/3029) [`eed5e6cf`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/eed5e6cf00f94f3011b93825ccce43cb2270c247) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed importing in Node ESM

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2819](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2819) [`bbad8c79`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/bbad8c79937f8dfd5d93bf485c1e9ec44124d228) Thanks [@nicksrandall](https://github.com/nicksrandall)! - `exports` field has been added to the `package.json` manifest. It limits what files can be imported from a package but we've tried our best to allow importing all the files that were considered to be a part of the public API.

It fixes the issue with browser-specific files being prioritized by some bundlers when targeting workers.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2600](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2600) [`2f27156a`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/2f27156a73f94c3aac82e4ed492cbfdc97225573) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Introduced `registerStyles` helper that is shared across between other packages. This is just an internal util that shouldn't be used by packages other than `@emotion/*` packages.

The change is internal and has no effect on Emotion users.
