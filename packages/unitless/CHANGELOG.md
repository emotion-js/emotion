## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2819](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2819) [`bbad8c79`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/bbad8c79937f8dfd5d93bf485c1e9ec44124d228) Thanks [@nicksrandall](https://github.com/nicksrandall)! - `exports` field has been added to the `package.json` manifest. It limits what files can be imported from a package but we've tried our best to allow importing all the files that were considered to be a part of the public API.
