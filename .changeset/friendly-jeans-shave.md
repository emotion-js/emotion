What: Add autocomplete suggestion for styled. Fixes #3312

Why: When typing "styled" while coding, there are no autocompletion suggestions for styled. It's expected behavior is to have a suggestion option and when selected, imports styled like this: import styled from @emotion/styled

How: The previous code imports the base styled as styled. This changes it to baseStyled so the module can use styled as the default export.
