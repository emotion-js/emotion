`styled` is a way to create React components that have styles attached to them. It's available from [@emotion/styled](/packages/@emotion/styled). `styled` was heavily inspired by [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [glamorous](https://glamorous.rocks/)

### Styling elements and components

`styled` is very similar to `css` except you call it with an html tag or React component and then call that with a template literal for string styles or a regular function call for object styles.

```jsx
// @live
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const Button = styled.button`
  color: turquoise;
`

render(<Button>This my button component.</Button>)
```

### Changing based on props

Any interpolations or arguments that are functions in `styled` are called with `props`, this allows you to change the styles of a component based on the props.

```jsx
// @live
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const Button = styled.button`
  color: ${props =>
    props.primary ? 'hotpink' : 'turquoise'};
`

const Container = styled.div(props => ({
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: props.column && 'column'
}))

render(
  <Container column>
    <Button>This is a regular button.</Button>
    <Button primary>This is a primary button.</Button>
  </Container>
)
```

### Styling any component

`styled` can style any component as long as it accepts a `className` prop.

```jsx
// @live
import styled from '@emotion/styled'
const Basic = ({ className }) => (
  <div className={className}>Some text</div>
)

const Fancy = styled(Basic)`
  color: hotpink;
`

render(<Fancy />)
```

### Change the rendered tag using `withComponent`

Sometimes you want to create some styles with one component but then use those styles again with another component, the `withComponent` method can be used for this. This was inspired by [styled-components' `withComponent`](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#withcomponent).

```jsx
// @live
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const Section = styled.section`
  background: #333;
  color: #fff;
`
// this component has the same styles as Section but it renders an aside
const Aside = Section.withComponent('aside')
render(
  <div>
    <Section>This is a section</Section>
    <Aside>This is an aside</Aside>
  </div>
)
```

### Targeting another emotion component

Similar to [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/faqs#can-i-refer-to-other-components), emotion allows for emotion components to be targeted like regular CSS selectors when using [babel-plugin-emotion](/packages/babel-plugin-emotion.md).

```jsx
// @live
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const Child = styled.div`
  color: red;
`

const Parent = styled.div`
  ${Child} {
    color: green;
  }
`

render(
  <div>
    <Parent>
      <Child>Green because I am inside a Parent</Child>
    </Parent>
    <Child>Red because I am not inside a Parent</Child>
  </div>
)
```

Component selectors can also be used with object styles.

```jsx
// @live
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const Child = styled.div({
  color: 'red'
})

const Parent = styled.div({
  [Child]: {
    color: 'green'
  }
})

render(
  <div>
    <Parent>
      <Child>green</Child>
    </Parent>
    <Child>red</Child>
  </div>
)
```

### Object styles

```jsx
// @live
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const H1 = styled.h1(
  {
    fontSize: 20
  },
  props => ({ color: props.color })
)

render(<H1 color="lightgreen">This is lightgreen.</H1>)
```

This API was inspired by [glamorous](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous). ❤️

### Customizing prop forwarding

By default, Emotion passes all props to custom components and only props that are valid html attributes for string tags. You can customize this by passing a custom `shouldForwardProp` function. You can also use `@emotion/is-prop-valid` (which is used by emotion internally) to filter out props that are not valid as html attributes.

```jsx
// @live
import isPropValid from '@emotion/is-prop-valid'
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const H1 = styled('h1', {
  shouldForwardProp: prop =>
    isPropValid(prop) && prop !== 'color'
})(props => ({
  color: 'hotpink'
}))

render(<H1 color="lightgreen">This is lightgreen.</H1>)
```

### Composing dynamic styles

You can create dynamic styles that are based on props and use them in styles.

```jsx
// @live
import styled from '@emotion/styled'
import { css } from '@emotion/core'

const dynamicStyle = props =>
  css`
    color: ${props.color};
  `

const Container = styled.div`
  ${dynamicStyle};
`
render(
  <Container color="lightgreen">
    This is lightgreen.
  </Container>
)
```

### `as` prop

To use styles from a styled component but change the element that's rendered, you can use the `as` prop.

```jsx
// @live
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const Button = styled.button`
  color: hotpink;
`

render(
  <Button
    as="a"
    href="https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion"
  >
    Emotion on GitHub
  </Button>
)
```

This API was inspired by [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com). ❤️

The `as` prop is only used by styled when it's not forwarded to the underlying element. By default, this means that the `as` prop is used for html tags and forwarded for components. To change this, you can pass a custom [`shouldForwardProp`](#customizing-prop-forwarding) which returns `true` for `'as'` to forward it or returns `false` for `'as'` to use it and not forward it.

### Nesting components

We can nest selectors using `&`:

```jsx
// @live

import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const Example = styled('span')`
  color: lightgreen;
  & > a {
    color: hotpink;
  }
`

render(
  <Example>
    This is <a>nested</a>.
  </Example>
)
```
