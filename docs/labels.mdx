title: 'Labels'
---

Emotion adds a css property called `label`, the value of it is appended to the end of the class name, so it's more readable than a hash. `@emotion/babel-plugin` adds these labels automatically based on the variable name and other information, so they don't need to be manually specified.

```jsx
// @live
/** @jsx jsx */
import { css, jsx } from '@emotion/react'

let style = css`
  color: hotpink;
  label: some-name;
`

let anotherStyle = css({
  color: 'lightgreen',
  label: 'another-name'
})

let ShowClassName = ({ className }) => (
  <div className={className}>{className}</div>
)

render(
  <div>
    <ShowClassName css={style} />
    <ShowClassName css={anotherStyle} />
  </div>
)
```

## SSR & Safari

If using server side rendering, you may get the following warning when running
your app in Safari:

```text
Warning: Prop `className` did not match.
```

This means that Emotion was unable to determine the label because Safari did a
Proper Tail Call optimization. Don't worry â€” Emotion only does automatic label
extraction in development, so this won't affect your production app.

If you see this warning in another browser, please open an issue as it may be a
bug.
