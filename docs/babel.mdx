title: 'Babel Plugin'
---

`@emotion/babel-plugin` is highly recommended. All of the options that can be provided to `@emotion/babel-plugin` are documented in [`@emotion/babel-plugin`'s README](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/tree/main/packages/babel-plugin).

## Install

In `emotion` version 8 and above, installation is optional. In older versions, installation is required. See the [installation instructions](/docs/install.mdx).

## Features which are enabled with the babel plugin

#### Minification

Any leading/trailing space between properties in your `css` and `styled` blocks is removed. This can reduce the size of your final bundle.

#### Dead Code Elimination

Uglifyjs will use the injected `/*#__PURE__*/` flag comments to mark your `css` and `styled` blocks as candidates for dead code elimination.

#### Source Maps

When enabled, navigate directly to the style declaration in your javascript file.

#### Components as Selectors

This feature allows you to refer to other Emotion components in your CSS selectors to apply override styles depending on nesting context. Learn more in the [styled docs](/docs/styled.mdx#targeting-another-emotion-component). Only components defined with `styled` can be used as component selectors.
