The [`react/no-unknown-property` rule](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-unknown-property.md) from [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) will produce an error if the `css` prop is passed to a DOM element. This violation of the rule can be safely ignored because `@emotion/react` intercepts the `css` prop before it is applied to the DOM element.

The rule can be configured to ignore the `css` prop like so:

```json
"rules": {
  "react/no-unknown-property": ["error", { "ignore": ["css"] }]
},
```
