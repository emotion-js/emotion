## Objects as Styles

`css` can also take an object as a parameter. 
This allows you to use your existing object styles in the emotion ecosystem. 
Another great benefit is that you can now use [polished](https://polished.js.org/) with emotion!

*Object styles cannot be optimized as well as template literal styles at this time. Object styles are also not autoprefixed.*
