**Should I use Emotion in my library?**

If you are writing a component library, carefully consider whether your library will depend on Emotion. A simple alternative is to include a regular CSS file in your package, which your users bring in via a normal `import` statement.

If you're reading this, you probably know about Emotion's many benefits. Here are some drawbacks to consider:

- Consumers of the library will have to use the same version of Emotion as the library. There will be issues if, for example, your library depends on Emotion 10 but a user's application depends on Emotion 11.
- If your package only contains a handful of small components, Emotion may significantly increase your package's bundle size.
- Emotion may be more error prone than a simple CSS file in certain edge cases. In a previous version of [react-loading-skeleton](https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton) which utilized Emotion 10, we received reports of styles not working in production builds, iframes, and the shadow DOM.
