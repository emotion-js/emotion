title: 'Babel Macros'
---

[Create React App recently added support for Babel Macros](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/01/create-react-app-v2.html) which makes it possible to run Babel transforms without changing a Babel config.

All of Emotion's Babel Macros are available by adding `/macro` to the end of the import you'd normally use. (assuming you're using Create React App v2 or you've added babel-plugin-macros to your .babelrc) For example, to use the macro for styled, use `@emotion/styled/macro`.

```jsx
import styled from '@emotion/styled/macro'
import { jsx, css, Global, keyframes } from '@emotion/core/macro'
import { css, keyframes, injectGlobal } from 'emotion/macro'
```

> Note
>
> There are some optimisations which aren't possible with Babel Macros, so if it's possible, we still recommend using babel-plugin-emotion
