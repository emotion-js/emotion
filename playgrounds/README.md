# Emotion Development Playgrounds

These are intended to be places to experiment with behaviour that is hard to do in tests or a CodeSandbox. These are not intended to be perfect examples of how you would write emotion code with these other libraries as they will generally be focussed on edge cases.

## Getting Started

In the root of the repository, run this command to start building emotion

```bash
yarn build:watch
```

Then choose the playground you want to use and run the commands in the given package.json
